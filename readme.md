# ðŸ“š BookTracker

**BookTracker** is a simple application built with Node.js and Express that allows users to track books they want to read and books they have already read. Using Sequelize as an ORM to interact with MySQL database, the project provides a RESTful API to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) book information.

## Functionalities

- **Add Books**: Add new books that you want to read or have read.
- **List All Books**: List all books stored in the database.
- **Get Book by ID**: Get specific details of a book using its ID.
- **Update Book**: Update information of an existing book.
- **Delete Book**: Remove a book from the database.
